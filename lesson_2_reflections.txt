What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	When a repository is initialized, there is not any commit. We should create one by ourselves.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a tool that allows to load two files pass the files that will be commited in a non-fixed path. It is value to not saturate therepository with plenty of files.
